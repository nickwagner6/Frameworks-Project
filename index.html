            <strong>Look, if you had one shot, or one opportunity
                To seize everything you ever wanted, in one moment
                Would you capture it, or just let it slip?
                
                Yo! His palms are sweaty, knees weak, arms are heavy
                There's vomit on his sweater already: Mom's spaghetti
                He's nervous, but on the surface he looks calm and ready
                To drop bombs, but he keeps on forgetting
                What he wrote down, the whole crowd goes so loud
                He opens his mouth, but the words won't come out
                He's choking, how? Everybody's joking now
                The clock's run out, time's up, over, blaow!
                Snap back to reality, ope there goes gravity, ope
                There goes Rabbit, he choked, he's so mad but he won't
                Give up that easy, no, he won't have it, he knows
                His whole back's to these ropes, it don't matter, he's dope
                He knows that but he's broke, he's so stagnant, he knows
                When he goes back to this mobile home, that's when it's
                Back to the lab again yo, this whole rhapsody
                Better go capture this moment and hope it don't pass him, and
                
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo
                You better…
                
                His soul's escaping through this hole that is gaping
                This world is mine for the taking, make me king
                As we move toward a New World Order
                A normal life is boring; but superstardom's
                Close to post-mortem, it only grows harder
                Homie grows hotter, he blows, it's all over
                These hoes is all on him, coast-to-coast shows
                He's known as the Globetrotter, lonely roads
                God only knows, he's grown farther from home, he's no father
                He goes home and barely knows his own daughter
                But hold your nose, 'cause here goes the cold water
                These hoes don't want him no mo', he's cold product
                They moved on to the next schmoe who flows
                He nose-dove and sold nada, and so the soap opera
                Is told, it unfolds, I suppose it's old, partner
                But the beat goes on: da da dum da dum da da da da
                
                You better lose yourself in the music
                The moment, you own it, you better never let it go
                You only get one shot, do not miss your chance to blow
                This opportunity comes once in a lifetime, yo

                You better…
                
                No more games, I'ma change what you call rage
                Tear this motherfuckin' roof off like two dogs caged
                I was playin' in the beginning, the mood all changed
                I've been chewed up and spit out and booed off stage
                But I kept rhymin' and stepped right in the next cypher
                Best believe somebody's payin' the Pied Piper
                All the pain inside amplified by the
                Fact that I can't get by with my 9-to-5
                And I can't provide the right type of life for my family
                'Cause man, these goddamn food stamps don't buy diapers
                And there's no movie, there's no Mekhi Phifer, this is my life
                And these times are so hard, and it's gettin' even harder
                Tryna feed and water my seed, plus teeter-totter
                Caught up between bein' a father and a prima donna
                Baby mama drama, screamin' on her, too much for me to wanna
                Stay in one spot, another day of monotony's
                Gotten me to the point I'm like a snail, I've got
                To formulate a plot or end up in jail or shot
                Success is my only motherfuckin' option, failure's not
                Mom, I love you, but this trailer's got
                To go; I cannot grow old in Salem's Lot
                So here I go, it's my shot: feet, fail me not
                This may be the only opportunity that I got
                
                You better lose yourself in the music

                Music is like magic, there's a certain feelin' you get
                When you real and you spit, and people are feelin' your shit
                This is your moment, and every single minute you spend
                Tryna hold on to it 'cause you may never get it again
                So while you're in it, try to get as much shit as you can
                And when your run is over, just admit when it's at its end
                'Cause I'm at the end of my wits with half the shit that gets in
                I got a list, here's the order of my list that it's in
                It goes Reggie, Jay-Z, 2Pac and Biggie
                André from OutKast, Jada, Kurupt, Nas, and then me
                But in this industry I'm the cause of a lot of envy
                So when I'm not put on this list, the shit does not offend me
                That's why you see me walk around like nothing's botherin' me
                Even though half you people got a fuckin' problem with me
                You hate it, but you know respect you got to give me
                The press's wet dream, like Bobby and Whitney — Nate, hit me!
                
                'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
                'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
                'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
                I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse

                Soon as a verse starts, I eat at an MC's heart
                What is he thinking? How not to go against me, smart
                And it's absurd how people hang on every word
                I'll prob'ly never get the props I feel I ever deserve
                But I'll never be served, my spot is forever reserved
                If I ever leave Earth, that would be the death of me first
                'Cause in my heart of hearts I know nothin' could ever be worse
                That's why I'm clever when I put together every verse
                My thoughts are sporadic, I act like I'm an addict
                I rap like I'm addicted to smack like I'm Kim Mathers
                But I don't wanna go forth and back in constant battles
                The fact is I would rather sit back and bomb some rappers
                So this is like a full-blown attack I'm launchin' at 'em
                The track is on some battlin' raps, who wants some static?
                'Cause I don't really think that the fact that I'm Slim matters
                A plaque and platinum status is whack if I'm not the baddest, so
                
                'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
                'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth
                'Til the smoke clears out, am I high? Perhaps
                I'ma rip this shit 'til my bones collapse
                (Until the roof) 'Til the roof comes off, 'til the lights go out
                (The roof comes off) 'Til my legs give out, can't shut my mouth

                Give out from underneath me
                I, I will not fall, I will stand tall
                Feels like no one can beat me

                Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
                Really I have no idea
                All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
                I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been
                
                Got no time for no haters in this bitch
                Or toleration for this shit
                But like medication, my dedication
                And the time it takes to do this shit
                Reminds me of how an overcrowded hospital waitin' room'll get
                What I mean is maybe I have more patience than I'm able to admit
                Yeah, but I'm still mentally stable as a three-legged table in this bitch
                Fame was a switch but I was grateful to trade that shit for the trailer with the hitch
                Thought it would made me a ravin' lunatic
                But I made it through to my situation, I hit pay dirt
                Now I get paper like a stapler in this bitch
                But just 'cause I made a little bit of change
                Don't mean I've changed a little bit
                Brain full of wit, dangerous, can't extinguish this English language when it's lit
                Now I'm just paradin', you would still get Shady 'til I'm eighty two
                I spit this crazy, even Dre he knows I'ma blow
                Better get the handkerchief again, haha
                
                Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
                Really I have no idea
                All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
                I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been (my only question is)
                (I know I talk about this shit a lot but)
                Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
                Really I have no idea
                All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
                I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been
                
                Oh, now what am I gonna do?
                Can't nothing hold me, I'm on the loose
                Born a winner, damn it's so hard to lose
                I can do it even when I'm tryin' to
                When my record flop, it still go through the roof
                This atmosphere's for a chosen few
                Who was on their grind, makin' money moves
                And you ain't gon' get there if you water down
                You gotta take shots with 100 proof
                
                Check that
                Been in survival mode
                Since a five year old, it was I alone
                Since my trike was stole, spiral notebook and microphone
                But lookin' back how bad it was then
                If it hadn't been for the pad and the pen
                Addict mom and deadbeat dad
                I wouldn't have the savage within
                Havin' to win, every single battle I'm in
                All I ever wanted was to be an MC
                Tediously I wrote obediently, believing in me
                EPMD must've had teachin' degrees
                Learn to defeat enemies with the ink, thinkin' of these rhymes
                Would be as easy as eatin' graffiti
                Would be like remedial readin' to me (yeah)
                'Til my last breath leave my lungs, I'ma beat my drums (yeah)
                For the streets I'm from (yeah)
                The east side slums (yeah)
                Gotta remind 'em (yeah)
                I take a foe out (yeah), like fee-fi-fum
                You see my finger (what), you see my thumb (what?)
                You see my fist, f*ck a peach pipe bum (what?)
                For the smoke but it's not the weed I want (what?)
                With this beat I brung for the beef I come (woo)
                But you better bring it if you wanna reply from
                'Cause for you to be lyrically inclined, it'd be a steep climb up
                That'll be an uphill battle
                But I'm off kickin' feet in the recliner
                And I think I'm up
                'Bout to go out on a limb like a tree climber
                Time to push my ceiling higher 'cause
                
                Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
                Really I have no idea
                All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
                I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been
                (For the last time, man)
                Where am I supposed to go from here? Oh hey, oh-oh-oh
                Really I have no idea
                All I know is every time I think I hit my ceiling
                I go higher than I've ever fuckin' been
